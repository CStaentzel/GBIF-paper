#' Finish with functional approach

#' @description 
#' We created six functional groups

#' Macroinvertebrates were split by Insects, Crustaceans, and Molluscs, to represent differences in dispersal capabilities, 
which is an important determinant of sensitivity to habitat modifications 

#Fish were split into three modalities focusing on their spawning habitat: (i) euryoparous: generalists, with no clear spawning habitat preferences, 
(ii) limnoparous: preference to spawn in slow or stagnant waters, and (iii) rheoparous: preference to spawn in running waters
